# SpaceSniffer - unofficial source

SpaceSniffer is a freeware disk space analyzer for Windows that make use of the Treemap concept to view the current disk usage. Among the most notable features you'll find:

Features

- drag and drop support

- intuitive structure layout (multiple views for different media)

- zoom elements (browser-like navigation)

- powerful filtering (you can filter your results based on size file name age)

- customizable options (geometry, colors, behavior)

- fast scan of your hard drive (navigation worked even when the scan didn't finish)

- support for NTFS Alternate Data Streams and so on.

SpaceSniffer is fully portable on all modern Microsoft Windows versions (doesn't have a setup file. Therefore it doesn't mess up with your current registry - it just adds an XML configuration file). You can use the executable file on other Microsoft Windows OS; there's no need to extract the archive each time.
