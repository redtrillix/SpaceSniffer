How to interpret the Version Number
-----------------------------------
SpaceSniffer version number is composed by four digits:

     application.major.minor.release (example: 1.0.3.18)

Application digit will change only when really big modifications
are made. Such modifications would affect the application in deep.
Read it as a whole application rewriting from scratch, maybe even 
programming language change. When this digit change, all minor
digit will be zeroed. This digit will likely never change in the 
life of this SpaceSniffer.

Major digit will change when major modifications are made.
Read it as a "new very important functions available" flag.
When this digit change, all minor digit will be zeroed.

Minor digit will change when minor modifications or enhancements 
are made. Maybe new useful functions are added but not so important
on the usage of the application. When this digit change, all minor
digit will be zeroed.

Release digit will change when only bug fixes are applied.

So, if bug fixes are applied but also new features are added,
the Major or Minor digits will prevail on Release digit.
